# One-Dimensional-Chain - Readme file

I have uploaded some codes of my project on Thermal Conduction in single-dimension chains.

The codes expresses the conductivity of several types of chains including linear chains, damped chains, chains with cubic and quadratic parameter as well as Fermi-Pasta Ulam Chain

The codes are written in C, and C++ language
